# adventofcode

Be warned, unless stated otherwise, these are horrifyingly inefficient, unreadable and nonsensical solutions to Advent Of Code puzzles.
I wish I could blame that entirely on the fact that I do try solve them as quickly as possible, but my inexperience and lack of programming talent, 
particularly in the speed category, is probably more to blame.

View at your own risk!
